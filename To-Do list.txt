Tyler likes to-do lists (at least for him) so here's a to-do list

Bullet Acceleration? slightly?
Definately have rotation acceleration though
Add a way to set the bullet's up vector to up (so, if its upsidedown, it can become right side up)
Get bullet style rotation to work for the player
Add some basic UI stuff
Models for stuff
Make targets able to move
Add obstacles in the way
